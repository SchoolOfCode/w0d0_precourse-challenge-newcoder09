## DR Anne Marie Imafidon MBE

The reason I chose to build my first project on Dr Anne Marie is because it is thanks to her that I am learning at The School of Code today.  

My daughter aged 6 at the time came home from school all excited because she had been working on [Scratch.](https://www.scratch.mit.edu) She continued to use this but it was evident I couldn't help her to progress.   

I began looking for classes in London, there was very little available. However we did come across a HACKATHON run by a company called [Stemettes.](https://www.stemettes.org) (*the director was DR Anne Marie Imafidon.*) The event was specifically for girls aged 5-18 working on a project with the aim of getting girls into STEM. 

It was only right that I should dedicate my first project to DR Anne Marie as she is a true leader in TECH.
